"""This is my first project using Python and API, I hope you will enjoy it
I appreciate a lot your opinions about it, thank you

This is a small program where you can search pokemon by name, and see their skills, also you can see the entire Pokemon list

This program gets all the info from the PokeAPI https://pokeapi.co/
